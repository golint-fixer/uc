\subsection{Project Future}
\label{sec:project_future}

Since a very early stage of development, we were both discussing where we may wish to take this project in the future and how we may wish to continue developing it. The obvious aims for the future would be to extend the supported language constructs of C. Prior to this work, we intend to spend some time cleaning up the code base, reviewing past design decisions and fixing issues caused by time constraints (such as the IR generation of array index expressions, etc).

Supplementary future plans for the project is to continue developing the LLVM IR library, and make it available for general use by other Go projects which may which to interact with LLVM IR. The library is already being used by a decompiler project to generate control flow graphs from LLVM IR.
