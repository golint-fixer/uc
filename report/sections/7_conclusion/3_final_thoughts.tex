It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is about compilers and compiler development that is so captivating. Gaining a deeper understanding of programming languages by looking under the hood of the low-level abstractions provides a refreshing insight into the conceptual building blocks which guide our thoughts and creative processes when developing software.

To conclude, it does feel like a right of passage to develop a C compiler on your own. We feel honoured to have been given this opportunity of doing so, and would recommend anyone interested to give it a shot. But be careful, compiler development is addictive!
