\subsection{Project Summary}
\label{sec:project_summary}

All things considered, the project has been hugely successful as we've managed to implement a compiler which translates uC programs into LLVM IR assembly, as was our initial intentions. We cannot thank Alexandra enough for taking the time to supervising this project, as it has been a hugely rewarding experience to gain practical experience on developing a compiler. It has sparked our interest in compilers even more, and we feel excited for future opportunities of working together with the compiler group at Uppsala University.
