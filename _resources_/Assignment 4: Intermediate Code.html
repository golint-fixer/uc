 <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<p class="first">Implement a translation from abstract syntax to an RTL-like
intermediate code for the uC language.</p>

<p>The main tasks for the translator are to</p>

<ul>
<li>flatten control structures,</li>

<li>translate variable declarations,</li>

<li>translate variable references in expressions, and</li>

<li>flatten expressions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flatten control structure</h3>

<p class="first">Each control-flow statement needs to be broken down to RTL code using
labels, jumps, and conditional jumps.</p>

<p>The <code>return</code> statement should be translated to an assignment to the
return value (in the SML framework, the temporary <code>RTL.RV</code> is reserved
for this purpose) followed by a jump to the end of the procedure body.</p>


<h3>Translate variable declarations</h3>

<p class="first">For a global variable or a local array variable, the translation
requires computing the size in bytes of the variable.</p>

<p>Local arrays are stored in a memory area pointed to by the virtual
frame pointer (in the SML framework, this is <code>RTL.FP</code>). The translation
must map each local array to a suitable offset in the virtual
frame. It must also compute the size of the virtual frame and record
that in the function object. (Later the virtual frame will be embedded
in the actual stack frame.)</p>

<p>The translation needs to maintain a mapping from abstract syntax
variable names to their storage locations in the RTL form: labels for
global variables, temporaries for actual parameters and local scalar
variables, and virtual frame offsets for local array variables.</p>

<p>Scalar variables and arrays should also be distinguished.</p>


<h3>Translate variables references in expressions</h3>

<p class="first">To translate variables occurring in expressions, you need to use the
variable name mapping mentioned above.</p>

<p>For scalar variables, the translation needs to distinguish between
global and local variables. Function parameters are like local
variables.</p>

<p>For array variables, the translation needs to distinguish between
global variables, local variables, and arrays passed as function
parameters. In the first case the address of the storage area is known
via its label.  In the second case the address is computed as
<code>RTL.FP</code> plus a constant offset.  In the third case the address
is passed in a scalar pointer variable.</p>


<h3>Flatten expressions</h3>

<p class="first">You need to flatten expressions to sequences of assignments and simple
expressions with only constants or temporaries as operands.</p>

 <h1>The report</h1>

<p class="first">In the report you should describe:</p>

<ul>
<li>how control flow statements are translated</li>

<li>how variable references are translated, and how you
handle the difference between local and global variables,
and the difference between scalar and array variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Also include RTL output from compiling the following programs:</p>

<pre class="example">quiet/lexer/l05.c
quiet/rtl/r01.c
quiet/rtl/r02.c
quiet/rtl/r03.c
quiet/rtl/r04.c
quiet/rtl/r05.c
</pre>



</div><div class="slide">
 <h1>Hints</h1>

<p class="first">Note that in C, an array variable cannot be assigned, but the
individual array elements can be. When the array is passed as a
parameter to a function. the intermediate code will pass the base
address of the array.</p>

<p>Make sure your implementation handles the available test
programs in the course directory before you hand in your solution.</p>


</div><div class="slide">
 <h1>Non SML/NJ users</h1>

<p class="first">If you are writing your compiler in a different language than SML/NJ,
then you will need to design your RTL-like intermediate language and
implement data types for representing it (or use one I propose in
the tutorial). The RTL language will probably be similar to your
implementation of the abstract syntax tree, but simpler and more
low-level.</p>

<p>Also please document your RTL language. Present the set of instructions
in a style similar to the one I give in the <code>c-rtl</code> example. If you make
any design choices that differ from the proposed design, please
explain them.</p>

<p>You should also define a way to output your RTL code in a readable
format. As part of your solution, you should give output for some of
the programs in the test suite (they are listed above).</p>


</div><div class="slide">
 <h1>SML/NJ users</h1>

<p class="first">Implement the translation from abstract syntax to RTL by extending the
incomplete translator <code>rtl/absyn-to-rtl.sml</code> in the <code>ucc</code> lab skeleton.</p>

<p>You can pass the <code>--print-rtl</code> option to the compiler to make it print
the intermediate RTL representation to a text file.  This can be
useful for checking that the translation is correct.</p>
